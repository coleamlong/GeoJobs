## The proposed project


URLs of at least three disparate data sources that you will programmatically scrape using a RESTful API (be very sure about this)

at least three models

an estimate of the number of instances of each model

each model must have many attributes

describe at least five of those attributes for each model that you could filter by or sort by on the model (grid) pages

describe at least five additional attributes for each model that you could search for on the instance pages

each model must connect to at least two other models

each model must be rich with different media (e.g., feeds, images, maps, text, videos, etc.) (be very sure about this)

describe at least two types of media for each model that you could display on the instance pages

what three questions will you answer due to doing this data synthesis on your site?
